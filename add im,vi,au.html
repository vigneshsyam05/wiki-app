  <p class="s" >  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of other living beings, primarily of humans. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.</p>
  
  <p class="y">Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[3] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[4][5] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[6][7] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[8] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[9] This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.[10]</p>
    
<p class=" a">In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[255] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[5] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[7]</p>
  
  <p class = "m">In 1951, using a Ferranti Mark 1 computer of the University of Manchester, checkers and chess programs were wrote where you could play against the computer.[248] The field of American AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[r][3] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[s] They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":[t] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[u][4] Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US Universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[2]</p>
<p class = "v">Many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.[256] A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.[257] Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[w] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[85][262] But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[263] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[264]

<p class="i">Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[8] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[x] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[268] graphics processing units, cloud computing[269]) and access to large amounts of data[270] (including curated datasets,[269] such as ImageNet).

  Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[y] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015â€“2019,[234] and WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents.[271] According to 'AI Impacts', about $50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI";[272] about 800,000 "AI"-related US job openings existed in 2022.[273] The large majority of the advances have occurred within the United States, with its companies, universities, and research labs leading artificial intelligence research.[10]</p>
